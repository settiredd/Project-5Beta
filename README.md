# Project-5Beta

**This repository was shifted over from a different one**
-On the previous, Ben handled a most of the exception handling, server parameter creation, checking for invisibility and blocking, and checking for usernames existing. He also created a very useful readFile method that was used throughout the whole code as well as a selectOptions method that was used throughout the code as well.
