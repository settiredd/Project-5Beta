# Project-5Beta

**This repository was shifted over from a different one**
-On the previous, Ben handled some of the exception handling, server fields creation, isInvisible method, and isBlocked method. He also created a readFile method that was used throughout the whole code as well as a selectOptions method that was used throughout the code as well.
